# About

The *World War II Service Maps* collection gives us the opportunity  to empower faculty, students, and other digital scholars
 to remix and repurpose these assets for their own research and creative pursuits. This site serves as a demonstration
 of what can be done utilizing open systems and standards that the Libraries support.
