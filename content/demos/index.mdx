# Service Map Demonstrations

## Annotating Schematic Service Maps

The service maps collection features numerous schematic maps that prioritize illustrating connections over geographic
accuracy. These maps depict key relationships between operations, such as American forces' movements in the North
Apennines and Po Valley near the end of World War II. By incorporating georeferencing annotations and a georeferencing
viewer, we can add geospatial context to these schematic maps, helping users gain a clearer understanding of the
locations associated with each event node.
